# Frontend React Test

The test consist of building a blog app, following this [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/7TDv8jsZ36rUFFj2cwa4yT/Technical-Test---Javascript)

## User Stories.

### As an unauthenticated user.
- I can see blog posts available in the site
- I can see the full detail of each blog
- I can search for a post.
- When making a post a favorite I should be able to see a sign-up/sign-in modal 

> **Disclaimer:** To keep it simple, no need to built an auth system, just use the email as the identifier.

### As an authenticated user

- I can save a post (mark as favorite)
- I can see all my favorites posts
- I can search a previously saved post.
- I can remove a post from my favorites
- As a user I can create and edit posts

## API.

You should create a mock api using [JSON-SEVER](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/). You have total freedom in the db structure. 

## Deliverables

 - Code deployed, so we can see your app up and running.
 - Code uploaded to this repository.
 - Use this project to show your potencial, add any additional feature you consider.
 - **Time**. No need to rush it. (well, reasonably speaking, we don't expect you to take more than two days on it).

## Recomendations

 - Focus on your strengths not your weaknesses. It's better to have some sections at 100%, that the whole site at 80%.
 - Make your the app is responsive.
